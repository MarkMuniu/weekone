        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Mark Muniu and I'm currently on a very interesting journey of learning programming. I am passionate about learning more on coding because I want to enter the game development field which requires a lot of knowledge in most of the programming languages and so I decided to take on programming to aid me towards that end.</p>
